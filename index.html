              Hello! , World!! <br>
              I'm Hiroshi Igrashi. I live in Japan. Japan is a nice place to live.<br>
              There is a famous temple with a beautfiul Japanese park.<br>
              I currently live in Narita. However, Mu job entails long commuting time.<br>
              One of my hobbies is to go to karaoke. It is fun for me to sing rock songs.<br>
              Therefor, I'm thinking of moving to a provicial city. The city is Fukuoka where you can enjoy delitious food!<br>
            </p>

              Additionally, I love traveling. I have visited Canada , America and New Zealand.<br>
              About demestic trips, I recently visited Nagasaki, Kumamoto. These places were so interesting.<br>
              Nagasaki has a unique culture from other countries.<br>
              There is a magnificant church in Nagazaki city.<br>
              Also, Kumamoto has a unique cultur.<br>
              Recently, The religion that people of <a href="https://www.t-island.jp/"ã€€>Amakusa</a> in Kumamoto has become famous.<br>
              That is called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kakure_Kirishitan" > "Kakure Kirishitan"</a> which means "People who believe in Christian but they pretend to believe in Buddhism "<br>
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="col-3">

              My background is unique. Since I have been working as a software engineer.<br>
              I have worked as a clue of MacDonald's Canada.Lol<br>
              It was really memorable for me to work in the international environment!<br>
              In the future, I want to be a rockstar!!<br>
              That's why I go to karaoke once a week!<br>
              Karaoke is a excellent place to practice singing a song!<br>
              I neve mind my volume is too loud or not.<br>
              I always feel like I'm like Kurt Cobain who was a vocal and guitarist of Nirvana!<br>
              Anyway, Thank you so much to CS50's teachers and  classmate for visiting my web site!
